Part 3: Bug finding

This file contains a short program that calculates the "score" of a set
of currency denominations.
Unfortunately, it contains a bug -- your goal is to find and fix it.

=== Your task ===

Write a single test using Hypothesis to identify the bug.
Your test doesn't have to cover all behaviors on all inputs, but it should
test a more interesting behavior than just a single input.

After testing, please modify the code to fix the bug.
In addition, at the bottom of the file, fill in the function

    test_bug

with your test that was able to demonstrate the bug.
This function should fail on the original implementation and
pass on the fixed implementation.

=== Grading Notes ===

You shouldn't modify any function signatures - or modify any of the existing
code, other than the single bug fix!
The bug fix does not require fixing several different lines of code, it is isolated
in a single place.

Note that the parameter N is set to 100 by default (DEFAULT_N).
You may pass a different value of N in your test if needed, if you want
to try a different value of N,
but don't modify the global parameter DEFAULT_N.

We will grade your test by running it on the buggy and the fixed version of the program, to check if it can successfully identify the buggy version while
passing for the fixed version.

Your test should be a nontrivial Hypothesis test - it should cover behavior on more than one input,
not just the behavior on a single input.
So it should have at least one input parameter that is randomly generated.

=== Running the code ===

You can try out the code by running `python3 part3.py <list of integers>`.
For example:
```
    python3 part3.py 1 5 10 20 100
```
You can run your tests by running `pytest part3.py`.

=== Problem description ===

This program is about paper currency denominations.
For example, US currency is defined by the denominations
[1, 5, 10, 20, 50].

What is a good way to choose a set of currency denominations?

Let's define the "score" of a set of denominations as the product of:
    1. The average number of bills required to make a number from 1 to 100.
        For example, if the denominations are 1, 5, 10, 20, and 50, the number
        of bills required to make 47 is 5, 1 + 1 + 5 + 20 + 20. The average
        over all numbers from 1 to 100 turns out to be 4.22.
    2. The number of bills. For our example, this is 5, so the score would be 5 * 4.22 = 21.1.
(A lower score is better.)

The program is given as input a list of integers,
where at least one of the integers is 1.
The program outputs the score of the denominations.

=== Other helpful notes ===

You should think of this program as "someone else's code" -- you don't
necessarily want to rewrite it yourself, and it may have some conventions
you are not familiar with (for example, it is using type annotations).
So you shouldn't try to modify it directly.

Instead, try to understand what it's doing without reading every line.
Are there simple properties you can test about each method's behavior?
You don't have to write a test for every possible input -- try smaller
values of N or simple sets of denominations.
Are there some of these simpler cases where you can easily predict what the output
should be?
