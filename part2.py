Below we have a basic Python class that is used to store user information.
The user is defined by a name, an age, and a list of friends.

In Python, the __init__ method is called when a new object is created.
For example, to create a new user, we would write:
    user = User("Alice", 25, ["Bob", "Charlie"])

The other two methods are for convenience:
- The __repr__ method is used to print the object in a readable way,
    which often helps with debugging.
- The __eq__ method is used to compare two objects for equality.
"""

    def __init__(self, name, age, friends=None):

        self.age = age

            friends = []

1. Write a complete specification for the __init__ class method using Hypothesis.
Your specification should check that every field is correctly initialized.

Hint: st.one_of may be useful:

Remember to remove @pytest.mark.skip(reason="Unimplemented")

2. The next few exercises are about serialization and deserialization.

After we have our User class, we are told that we need to serialize
users to a CSV file.
Ignore the friends field for now, and assume that the CSV file will have
only two fields:
    name,age

Write a to_csv function and from_csv function based on this idea.
The to_csv function should take a User object and return a string.
The from_csv function should take a string and return a User object.

If either test failed:

4. What went wrong?

===== ANSWER Q4 BELOW =====
The second test failed when the name had a comma in it, since that was used as the delimiter for splitting.
===== END OF Q4 ANSWER =====

5. There are at least 4 ways we could modify our code:
- By changing the serialization function;
- By changing the deserialization function;
- By changing the precondition (for example, to require that st.text()
  does not contain commas);
- By changing the specification.

Which of the above solutions would succeed to get the tests passing?

===== ANSWER Q5 BELOW =====
Making the second, third, and fourth modifications would get the tests to pass.

6. Do you have a preferred solution?
Imagine this were a real application and real users were entering their names in
production. Would one of the above solutions be more secure than the others?

I would prefer to do the second modification, since some names do have commas in them

"""
15. Mutability can pose a serious problem when writing specifications.

Mutability is the ability of an object or function to change its state after
it has been created.

Let's add one last function to the User class, which applies a function to the age.
The function below (given to you) takes a function f as argument, and
returns a new User object.
Write a specification for the new function using Hypothesis.
Your specification should:
- create a user from name and age
- apply the function f to the age
- check that the new user's age matches the result of applying f to the original age.

Remember that you can use Hypothesis to generate functions.
We did an example of this in the lecture1.py file.
For this part, for the function argument, please use this:
    st.functions(like=lambda x: x,returns=st.integers())

The test should fail.

17. Bonus question (Extra credit):

The problem with the specification in exercise 16 is that it assumes f is pure,
but in the real world, this is not very realistic.
Many functions do have state, and f might be mutable or even mutate the user
object itself.

Is there any way to test that the function behaves correctly without assuming f is pure?

Answer in words only. Hint: Python is a highly dynamic language!

===== ANSWER Q17 BELOW =====
Yes, we can use a wrapper around the function that keeps track of the state over multiple calls of update_age_with.
